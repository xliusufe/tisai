\details{
Global temperature monthly data

This dataset contains global monthly temperature data from 1975 to 2023.

The gtemp.month dataset provides monthly global temperature data from 1975 to 2023. It is commonly used to study climate change trends, seasonal variations, and long-term temperature patterns. The data includes measurements from both land and ocean surfaces, providing a comprehensive view of global temperature changes over time.

\examples{
data(gtemp.month)

# Transpose the data for plotting
gtemp_t <- t(gtemp.month)

# Plot the temperature data for January
plot(rownames(gtemp_t), gtemp_t[, 1], type = "l", 
     main = "January Global Temperature",
     xlab = "Year", ylab = "Temperature (°C)", 
     col = "blue")

# Calculate summary statistics for each month
apply(gtemp.month, 1, summary)

# Plot average temperature across all months for each year
annual_avg <- colMeans(gtemp.month)
plot(names(annual_avg), annual_avg, type = "l",
     main = "Annual Average Global Temperature",
     xlab = "Year", ylab = "Temperature (°C)",
