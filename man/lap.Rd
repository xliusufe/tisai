\details{
LAP data

This dataset contains pollution and mortality data from Los Angeles, California, from 1970 to 1979.

The lap dataset provides weekly measurements of various pollution and health indicators from Los Angeles, California, from 1970 to 1979. It is commonly used in environmental health studies to analyze the effects of pollution on mortality, particularly for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The dataset includes measurements of multiple pollutants along with mortality rates, allowing researchers to investigate the relationships between specific pollutants and health outcomes.
